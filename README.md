## Introduction
### Background: Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) is a rare but complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with poor clinical outcome. We report a case of four-week prolonged intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) implementation to assist the patient with VSR, an unexpected event occurred after a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction. Surgical repair was not possible due to dual anti-platelet therapy for this patient. We then successfully performed the transcatheter closure to treat the VSR.

### Case presentation: A 72-year-old man presented with acute inferior myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed multi-vessel disease with total occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA) and severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). He underwent the percutaneous balloon angioplasty. One stent was placed and restored blood flow in RCA, but VSR occurred immediately after primary PCI. An IABP was inserted to stabilize the hemodynamics. Transthoracic echocardiography next day revealed an 11.4-mm left-to-right shunt in the posterior portion of the interventricular septum. Left ventriculography on day 28 confirmed an 11-mm left-to-right shunt in posterior ventricular septum. Transcatheter closure was conducted using a 24-mm double-umbrella occluder. The patient was weaned from IABP on day 31 and underwent secondary PCI for LAD lesions on day 35. The patient was discharged on day 41. A follow-up six years later with CAG and TTE revealed no in-stent restenosis, no left-to-right shunt, and 51% left ventricular ejection fraction.

### Conclusion: Prolonged implementation of IABP is a viable option to allow deferred transcatheter closure of VSR in AMI patients, and it is suitable to perform transcatheter closure to minimize the invasive procedure for the senior and vulnerable patient, who especially receives DAPT.
